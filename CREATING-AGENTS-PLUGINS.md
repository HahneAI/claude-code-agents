## Creating a New Agent

### Step 1: Choose the Right Plugin

Determine which existing plugin your agent belongs to:
- **Backend work?** ‚Üí `plugins/backend-development/`
- **Frontend work?** ‚Üí `plugins/frontend-mobile-development/`
- **Security?** ‚Üí `plugins/security-scanning/` or `plugins/backend-api-security/`
- **Database?** ‚Üí `plugins/database-design/` or `plugins/database-migrations/`
- **DevOps?** ‚Üí `plugins/cicd-automation/` or `plugins/cloud-infrastructure/`

Or create a new plugin (see [Creating a New Plugin](#creating-a-new-plugin))

### Step 2: Create Agent File

Create `plugins/{plugin-name}/agents/{agent-name}.md`

**Required Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
name: agent-name                    # Hyphen-case, lowercase
description: Brief description. Use PROACTIVELY when [trigger conditions].
model: opus                         # opus or sonnet (or haiku for simple tasks)
---
```

**Model Selection:**
- **Opus**: Complex architecture, strategy, critical decisions, multi-step reasoning
- **Sonnet**: Implementation, code generation, standard workflows, balanced tasks
- **Haiku**: Simple deterministic tasks, fast execution, straightforward operations

### Step 3: Write the Agent System Prompt

```markdown
---
name: my-custom-agent
description: Expert in [domain]. Masters [key technologies]. Use PROACTIVELY when [specific scenarios].
model: sonnet
---

You are an expert [role/persona] specializing in [domain].

## Purpose
[One paragraph explaining what this agent does and why it exists]

## Core Philosophy
[2-3 sentences about the agent's approach and values]

## Capabilities

### [Capability Category 1]
- **[Subcategory]**: Specific skills and knowledge
- **[Subcategory]**: More specific skills

### [Capability Category 2]
- **[Subcategory]**: Additional expertise
- **[Subcategory]**: More expertise

## Behavioral Traits
- [Trait 1]: How the agent behaves
- [Trait 2]: Decision-making approach
- [Trait 3]: Communication style
- [Trait 4]: Quality standards

## Workflow Position
- **Before**: [Which agents typically come before this one]
- **After**: [Which agents typically come after]
- **Complements**: [Which agents work alongside this one]

## Response Approach
1. [Step 1]: First thing the agent does
2. [Step 2]: Next action
3. [Step 3]: Then this
4. [Step 4]: Final deliverable

## Example Interactions
- "Example request 1"
- "Example request 2"
- "Example request 3"

## Key Distinctions
- **vs [similar-agent]**: How this agent differs
- **vs [another-agent]**: Key differences in scope or approach
```

### Step 4: Best Practices for Agent Prompts

**‚úÖ DO:**
- Be specific about expertise and technologies
- Include clear "Use PROACTIVELY when..." triggers
- List concrete capabilities with examples
- Define behavioral traits explicitly
- Show example interactions
- Explain workflow position relative to other agents
- Use consistent formatting and structure

**‚ùå DON'T:**
- Make agents too broad or general-purpose
- Forget the model selection (defaults to sonnet if omitted)
- Skip the description field (required for Claude to find the agent)
- Use vague language like "helps with various tasks"
- Duplicate capabilities from other agents without justification

---

## Creating a New Plugin

### When to Create a New Plugin

Create a new plugin when:
- Your domain doesn't fit existing plugins
- You need a focused container for 2-8 related components
- You're building a specialized workflow orchestrator
- You have multiple agents that work together in one domain

**Single Responsibility**: Each plugin should do ONE thing well (Unix philosophy)

### Step 1: Create Plugin Directory Structure

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/{plugin-name}/agents
mkdir -p plugins/{plugin-name}/commands
mkdir -p plugins/{plugin-name}/skills    # Optional
```

### Step 2: Add to Marketplace

Edit `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    {
      "name": "your-plugin-name",
      "description": "Brief description (1-2 sentences)",
      "agents": [
        "./agents/agent-one",
        "./agents/agent-two"
      ],
      "commands": [
        "./commands/command-one",
        "./commands/command-two"
      ],
      "skills": [
        "./skills/skill-one",
        "./skills/skill-two"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes:**
- Paths are relative to the plugin directory
- Omit `.md` extension from agent/command paths
- Skills use the skill directory name (not SKILL.md)
- Skills array is optional

### Step 3: Naming Conventions

**Plugin Names:**
- Hyphen-case: `backend-development`, `cloud-infrastructure`
- Descriptive: Clear domain indication
- Focused: Single responsibility
- 2-3 words max

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ `payment-processing` (clear, focused)
- ‚úÖ `kubernetes-operations` (clear domain)
- ‚úÖ `llm-application-dev` (specific use case)
- ‚ùå `utilities` (too vague)
- ‚ùå `miscellaneous-tools` (not focused)

---

## Creating a New Skill

### Understanding Skills

Skills are **auto-activating knowledge packages** that:
- Load progressively (metadata ‚Üí instructions ‚Üí resources)
- Activate based on keyword triggers in conversations
- Provide deep domain knowledge without loading everything upfront
- Follow the [Anthropic Agent Skills Specification](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/agent_skills_spec.md)

### Step 1: Create Skill Directory

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/{plugin-name}/skills/{skill-name}
```

### Step 2: Create SKILL.md File

Create `plugins/{plugin-name}/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md`:

```yaml
---
name: skill-name
description: What the skill does. Use when [activation trigger with specific keywords].
---

# Skill Name

   - Overview, Core Concepts, Implementation Patterns, Best Practices
   - ~500-1000 tokens

3. **Resources (On-Demand)**
   - Templates, Examples, References
   - ~1000-5000 tokens

### Step 5: Add to Plugin Manifest

Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin",
  "skills": [
    "./skills/your-skill-name"
  ]
}
```

---

## Creating a Slash Command

Slash commands are workflows accessible via `/plugin-name:command-name`

### Step 1: Create Command File

Create `plugins/{plugin-name}/commands/{command-name}.md`:

```markdown

```

### Step 2: Add to Plugin Manifest

Update `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "your-plugin",
  "commands": [
    "./commands/your-command-name"
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Usage

Users invoke with:
```
/your-plugin-name:your-command-name [arguments]
```

---

## Testing Your Creation

### Testing Agents

1. **Direct Invocation:**
   ```
   Use [agent-name] to [task description]
   ```

2. **Verify Behavior:**
   - Does the agent understand its role?
   - Does it use appropriate tools?
   - Does it follow its behavioral traits?
   - Does it defer to other agents when appropriate?

3. **Check Proactive Activation:**
   - Mention the agent's domain without calling it directly
   - See if Claude suggests using it
   - Verify "Use PROACTIVELY" triggers work

### Testing Skills

1. **Check Auto-Activation:**
   ```
   "Build a FastAPI endpoint with async patterns"
   ```
   Ask: "What skills are you using?"

2. **Verify Progressive Loading:**
   - Skill activates on keyword match
   - Instructions load when needed
   - Resources load on request

3. **Test Trigger Keywords:**
   - Use keywords from the description
   - Verify skill activates appropriately
   - Ensure no unwanted activation

### Testing Commands

1. **Direct Invocation:**
   ```
   /plugin-name:command-name argument1 argument2
   ```

2. **Verify Workflow:**
   - Does each phase execute in order?
   - Do agents receive proper context?
   - Are handoffs smooth between phases?
   - Do deliverables match expectations?

3. **Check Edge Cases:**
   - Missing arguments
   - Invalid options
   - Partial completion scenarios

## Examples

### Example Agent: Custom Database Tuner

```yaml
---
name: database-tuner-custom
description: Expert PostgreSQL performance tuner for Supabase. Masters query optimization, indexing strategies, and RLS policy performance. Use PROACTIVELY when optimizing slow queries, designing indexes, or improving multi-tenant database performance.
model: opus
---

You are a PostgreSQL performance tuning expert specializing in Supabase optimization.

## Purpose
Optimize PostgreSQL database performance with focus on query tuning, strategic indexing, and Row-Level Security (RLS) policy optimization for multi-tenant SaaS applications.

## Core Philosophy
Performance optimization should be data-driven, measurable, and maintainable. Always benchmark before and after changes. Prefer simple solutions over premature optimization.

## Capabilities

### Query Optimization
- **Execution Plan Analysis**: Read and interpret EXPLAIN ANALYZE output
- **Query Rewriting**: Transform slow queries into performant alternatives
- **N+1 Detection**: Identify and resolve N+1 query patterns
- **Join Optimization**: Optimize join strategies and join order

### Strategic Indexing
- **Index Selection**: Choose between B-tree, GiST, GIN, BRIN indexes
- **Composite Indexes**: Design multi-column indexes for query patterns
- **Partial Indexes**: Create filtered indexes for specific conditions
- **Index Maintenance**: Monitor bloat, rebuild when necessary

### RLS Policy Optimization
- **Policy Analysis**: Identify slow RLS policies
- **Security-Performance Balance**: Optimize without compromising security
- **Tenant Isolation**: Ensure performant multi-tenant data isolation

## Behavioral Traits
- Always starts with performance profiling before changes
- Measures impact with EXPLAIN ANALYZE and pg_stat_statements
- Documents all optimization decisions with rationale
- Tests changes in staging before production
- Considers query frequency and business impact

## Response Approach
1. **Profile**: Gather execution plans and statistics
2. **Analyze**: Identify bottlenecks and anti-patterns
3. **Recommend**: Propose specific optimizations with rationale
4. **Implement**: Provide tested SQL and index definitions
5. **Verify**: Show before/after performance metrics

## Example Interactions
- "This query is slow - help me optimize it"
- "Design indexes for our user dashboard queries"
- "Our RLS policies are causing performance issues"
```

### Example Skill: Supabase RLS Patterns

```yaml
---
name: supabase-rls-patterns
description: Design and optimize Row-Level Security policies for Supabase multi-tenant applications. Use when implementing tenant isolation, designing RLS policies, or optimizing PostgreSQL security performance in Supabase.
---

# Supabase RLS Patterns

## Overview
Row-Level Security (RLS) in Supabase provides tenant isolation and data security at the database level. This skill covers performant RLS policy design for multi-tenant SaaS applications.

## Core Concepts

### RLS Policy Types
- **SELECT Policies**: Control read access
- **INSERT Policies**: Control data creation
- **UPDATE Policies**: Control data modification
- **DELETE Policies**: Control data removal

### Tenant Isolation Patterns
- **User-based**: Isolation by user ID
- **Organization-based**: Isolation by org/tenant ID
- **Role-based**: Isolation by user roles

## Implementation Patterns

### Pattern 1: Organization Tenant Isolation

**Use when**: Multi-tenant SaaS with organization hierarchy

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Policy: Users see only their organization's projects
CREATE POLICY "Users see own org projects"
  ON projects
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    org_id IN (
      SELECT org_id
      FROM user_organizations
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );

-- Performance optimization: Index on foreign key
CREATE INDEX idx_projects_org_id ON projects(org_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_user_orgs_user_id ON user_organizations(user_id);
```

### Pattern 2: Role-Based Access with RLS

**Use when**: Different permission levels per tenant

```sql
-- Policy: Admins see all, users see own
CREATE POLICY "Role-based project access"
  ON projects
  FOR SELECT
  USING (
    -- Admins see everything
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM user_roles
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND role = 'admin'
      AND org_id = projects.org_id
    )
    OR
    -- Users see assigned projects
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM project_members
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
      AND project_id = projects.id
    )
  );
```

## Best Practices

1. **Index Foreign Keys**: Always index columns used in RLS policies
2. **Minimize Subqueries**: Use joins when possible, they're faster
3. **Test Performance**: Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE on queries with RLS
4. **Cache User Context**: Use security definer functions for expensive checks

## Common Pitfalls

- **Cartesian Products**: Avoid unindexed joins in policies
- **N+1 in Policies**: Don't create policies that cause N+1 queries
- **Missing Indexes**: Always index policy filter columns
