# Priority Agents Reference (Enhanced with Skills)

This document provides quick access to the most frequently used agents for your development workflows. Each agent is listed with its purpose, key capabilities, **available skills**, and installed location in the Claude Code plugin system.

**Updated:** All agents now reference their actual installed locations in the Claude Code plugin marketplace.

**New:** Each agent now shows which skills automatically activate from installed plugins when you use them!

---

## 1. Agent Selector ‚≠ê CRITICAL

**Plugin**: `claude-code-expert` (Custom Marketplace)
**Installed Location**: `C:\Users\antho\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\my-claude-plugins\claude-code-expert\agents\agent-selector.md`
**Model**: Opus
**Use Case**: Intelligent task routing and multi-agent workflow orchestration

### What It Does
Intelligent agent routing specialist that analyzes user requests and determines optimal agent(s), workflow sequence, and multi-agent coordination. This is the **FIRST agent** that should be considered for any complex task requiring agent selection or orchestration.

### Key Capabilities
- **Intent Classification**: Extract keywords, assess complexity, identify ambiguity
- **Agent Matching**: Select primary agents, identify support agents, consider skill auto-activation
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Define sequences (sequential/parallel), plan handoff points, optimize performance
- **Decision Trees**: Single vs multi-agent decisions, model selection (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku)
- **Agent Selection Matrix**: Complete knowledge of all agent specializations (backend, frontend, database, security, testing, payment, DevOps, mobile, AI, debugging, documentation)
- **Multi-Agent Patterns**: Architecture‚ÜíImplementation‚ÜíReview, TDD cycles, Security-first, Full-stack features, Performance optimization, Debugging investigations

### üéØ Available Skills (Auto-Activate)
From `claude-code-expert` plugin:
- **intent-classifier** - Agent routing logic, quick routing matrix, workflow patterns (WORKS HAND-IN-HAND WITH THIS AGENT)

### When to Use
- **PROACTIVELY for ANY complex task** - Before any actual implementation begins
- User request is ambiguous (could match multiple agents)
- Task complexity suggests multi-agent workflow might be better
- Unclear which agent specialization fits best
- Need to plan agent sequence for complex tasks
- Optimizing agent usage for performance
- **Whenever anything requiring agents is detected** - This agent ensures optimal routing

### Why It's #1 Priority
This agent operates at a **meta-level** above all execution agents. It ensures:
1. **Right agent, right time**: Prevents token waste and suboptimal results from poor routing
2. **Progressive complexity**: Starts simple, only escalates when truly needed
3. **Token efficiency**: Avoids redundant invocations, preloads relevant skills
4. **Workflow optimization**: Plans parallel execution, identifies handoff points

Without proper routing, even the best agents can produce suboptimal results. **agent-selector + intent-classifier** work together to ensure every task gets the optimal agent treatment.
